# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, as any people interested in this project could participate and bring new features to life.

If you haven't already, come find me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B574sHX) so we can chat about this project.

## Testing

Testing is basically try anything to make the application crashed or not working as expected and find a proper way to reproduce it.
When it's done (or if you can't find it out but you believe it's important), feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/waibcam/AutoSave-Highlights-for-Hunt-Showdown/issues).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/waibcam/AutoSave-Highlights-for-Hunt-Showdown/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
Ideally, make sure you have one feature = one commit.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
	
There is no guarantee I'll include you're commit, that's why, it's better if you talk to me in the first place on [Discord](https://discord.gg/B574sHX).

## Coding conventions

I am using TAB for Indent :-)
Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it.

Thanks!
